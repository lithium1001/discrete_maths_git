Title : Wipro Neural Intelligence Platform_x000D_
Team Size : 5_x000D_
Brief: WiproÃ¢Â€Â™s Neural Intelligence Platform harnesses the power of automation and artificial intelligence_x000D_
technologiesÃ¢Â€Â”natural language processing (NLP), cognitive, machine learning, and analytics. The platform_x000D_
comprises three layers: a data engagement platform that can easily access and manage multiple structured and_x000D_
unstructured data sources; an Ã¢Â€Âœintent assessment and reasoningÃ¢Â€Â engine that includes sentiment and predictive_x000D_
analytics; and a deep machine learning engine that can sense, act, and learn over time. The project entailed_x000D_
automating responses to user queries at the earliest. The Monster Bot using the power of Deep Machine Learning,_x000D_
NLP to handle such queries. User can see the how their queries can be answered quickly like allL1 activities can be_x000D_
eliminated._x000D_
Entity Extractor -> This involves text extraction and NLP for fetching out important information from the text like_x000D_
dates, names, places, contact numbers etc. This involves Regex, Bluemix NLU apiÃ¢Â€Â™s and machine learning using_x000D_
Tensor flow for further learning of new entities._x000D_
Classifier ->This involves the classifications of classes, training of dataset and predicting the output using the SKLearn_x000D_
classifier (MNB, SVM, SGD as Classifier) and SGD for the optimization to map the user queries with the best_x000D_
suited response and make the system efficient._x000D_
NER: A Deep Learning NER Model is trained to extract the entities from the text. Entities like Roles, Skills,_x000D_
Organizations can be extracted from raw text. RNN(LSTM) Bidirectional model is trained for extracting such entities_x000D_
using Keras TensorFlow framework._x000D_

Team Size : 5_x000D_
Brief: WiproÃ¢Â€Â™s Neural Intelligence Platform harnesses the power of automation and artificial intelligence_x000D_
technologiesÃ¢Â€Â”natural language processing (NLP), cognitive, machine learning, and analytics. The platform_x000D_
comprises three layers: a data engagement platform that can easily access and manage multiple structured and_x000D_
unstructured data sources; an Ã¢Â€Âœintent assessment and reasoningÃ¢Â€Â engine that includes sentiment and predictive_x000D_
analytics; and a deep machine learning engine that can sense, act, and learn over time. The project entailed_x000D_
automating responses to user queries at the earliest. The Monster Bot using the power of Deep Machine Learning,_x000D_
NLP to handle such queries. User can see the how their queries can be answered quickly like allL1 activities can be_x000D_
eliminated._x000D_
Entity Extractor -> This involves text extraction and NLP for fetching out important information from the text like_x000D_
dates, names, places, contact numbers etc. This involves Regex, Bluemix NLU apiÃ¢Â€Â™s and machine learning using_x000D_
Tensor flow for further learning of new entities._x000D_
Classifier ->This involves the classifications of classes, training of dataset and predicting the output using the SKLearn_x000D_
classifier (MNB, SVM, SGD as Classifier) and SGD for the optimization to map the user queries with the best_x000D_
suited response and make the system efficient._x000D_
NER: A Deep Learning NER Model is trained to extract the entities from the text. Entities like Roles, Skills,_x000D_
Organizations can be extracted from raw text. RNN(LSTM) Bidirectional model is trained for extracting such entities_x000D_
using Keras TensorFlow framework._x000D_
